### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

By building each component of an application in a modular format you are able to seperate pieces of the code into logical sections. By structuring your application using the MVC pattern you are able to keep specific functionalities isolated from eachother. For example, by placing all the CRUD functions in a "standalone" object class you can more easily maintain all operations related to communication with the database.

In the future, this Proof of Concept could be expanded to include a full range of database interactivity, including:
* Update existing records
* Insert new records
* Delete records
* Filter by additional fields
* Sort by specific fields
* Change the page size returned by a query 

### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
